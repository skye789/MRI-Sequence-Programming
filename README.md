Introduction
---
The basics of MR sequence programming is introducted, such as FID, spin echo, and gradient echo are programmed in Python. In addition, the basic image reconstruction based on the simulated and recorded data is written and carried out in Python, including radial imaging and iterative reconstruction. The sequences are created in a format that can be interpreted directly by MR scanners (https://pulseq.github.io).
